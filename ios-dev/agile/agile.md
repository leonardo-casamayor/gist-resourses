### Definition

Scrum in IT believes in empowered self-managed development teams with three specific and clearly defined roles. These roles include – Product Owner (PO), Scrum Master (SM) and the development team consisting of the programmers and testers. They work together in iterative time boxed durations called sprints.

---

# Roles

---

## PO
Product expert who represents the stakeholders, and is the voice of the customer.

---

## Scrum master
Organized servant-leader who ensures the understanding and execution of Scrum is followed.

---

## Development team
Group of professionals who deliver the product (developers, programmers, designers).

---

# Events

---

## Sprint
In Scrum, a sprint is a brief period of time during which a development team works to complete specific tasks, milestones, or deliverables. Sprints in agile methodology, also known as “iterations,” essentially divide the project schedule into digestible time blocks during which smaller goals can be achieved. The time frame does not exceed one calendar month and is consistent throughout the development process.

---

## Sprint planning

Where the entire Scrum team gets together—at the beginning of every Sprint—to plan the upcoming sprint.

---

## Daily Scrum
15-minute time-boxed meeting held at the same time, every day of the Sprint, where the previous day’s achievements are discussed, as well as the expectations for the following one.

---

## Sprint review
An informal meeting held at the end of every Sprint where the Scrum team presents their Increment to the stakeholders and discusses feedback.

---

## Sprint retrospective
A meeting where the Scrum team reflects on the proceedings of the previous Sprint and establishes improvements for the next Sprint.

---

# Artifacts

---

## Product Backlog

Managed by the Product Owner, it’s where all the requirements needed for a viable product are listed in order of priority. Includes features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that authorize any changes to be made to the product in future releases.

---

## Sprint Backlog

A list of the tasks and requirements that need to be accomplished during the next Sprint. Sometimes accompanied by a Scrum task board, which is used to visualize the progress of the tasks in the current Sprint, and any changes that are made in a ‘To Do, Doing, and Done’ format.
