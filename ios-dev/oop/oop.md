# OOP
# Object Oriented Programming

---

## Classes

Classes and Objects are basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming that revolve around real-life entities.

Set of object which shares common characteristics/ behavior and common properties/ attributes

- It is just a template or blueprint or prototype from which objects are created
- Class does not occupy memory
- Group of variables of different data types and a group of methods

---

## Objects

It is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents real-life entities.
When an object of a class is created, the class is said to be instantiated. All the instances share the attributes and the behavior of the class. But the values of those attributes, i.e. the state are unique for each object.

## Interface (Protocol)

An interface in is a blueprint of a behaviour.

- Interfaces specify what a class must do and not how
- Interface do not have constructor/initializer
- By using an interface we can achieve multiple inheritances

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation describes bundling data and methods that work on that data within one unit, like a class in Java. We often often use this concept to hide an object’s internal representation or state from the outside. This is called information hiding.

## Inheritance

It is the mechanism by which one class is allowed to inherit the features (properties and methods) of another class. 

Inheritance supports the concept of “reusability”, i.e. when we want to create a new class and there is already a class that includes some of the code that we want, we can derive our new class from the existing class. By doing this, we are reusing the fields and methods of the existing class.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways. In other words, polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations. This is achieved by two mechanisms:

- Method overriding
- Method overloading
